Project Title : News-feed-app

Overview : This project is a News-Feed App designed to display the latest news articles using the GNews API. The application leverages React.js for the frontend to providea smooth user interface,
while the backend fetches data from the GNews API to supply real-time news articles. The project is hosted on Firebase, allowing for seamless deployment and scaling. 
The goal is to deliver up-to-date news in an organized and user-friendly format, pulling articles from various sources.

Project Setup Instructions
To set up and run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites:
Node.js installed (v14.x or higher)
Firebase CLI installed (npm install -g firebase-tools)

1.Install dependencies:
If you're using npm:

npm install

2. GNews API Setup:
Go to GNews API and create an account to get your API key.
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your GNews API key:

REACT_APP_GNEWS_API_KEY=your-gnews-api-key

3. Firebase Setup:
Create a Firebase project at https://firebase.google.com.
In your Firebase console, enable Firebase Hosting.
Set up your Firebase config in the project. Replace the dummy config in firebaseConfig.js with your Firebase credentials:

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

4.Running the app locally:
To run the React app locally:

npm start

Overview of Approach : 

Approach
The News-Feed App was developed using a modular approach, focusing on creating a clean and scalable architecture. 
The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend, built with React.js,
and the backend that handles API calls to the GNews API.

Frontend (React.js):

I used React to create a responsive and dynamic UI. Components are designed to be reusable and efficiently display news articles in a user-friendly manner.
State management is handled using React’s hooks (useState, useEffect) to fetch and display the latest news on component load.
Styling is done using CSS modules or styled-components to ensure the design is clean and easily maintainable.
Backend/API Integration:

The backend is responsible for fetching data from the GNews API. I implemented an API call service that fetches the latest news articles based on categories or search queries.
I used asynchronous JavaScript (Promises/async/await) to handle API requests and ensure smooth data retrieval.
Firebase Hosting:

I chose Firebase to host the app due to its simplicity and ease of deployment. Firebase also offers scalability and ensures the app can handle increased traffic without requiring complex infrastructure setup.
Firebase’s CLI was used to deploy the app seamlessly, making it publicly accessible.
This structured approach ensures the app is maintainable, scalable, and performs efficiently across devices.


Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. API Rate Limiting
   
Challenge: The GNews API has a rate limit, which restricts the number of requests that can be made within a given time.
This made it difficult to consistently fetch data during testing and development.

Solution: I implemented a caching mechanism to store previously fetched news articles temporarily. This helped reduce unnecessary API calls and 
ensured the app displayed data even when the API limit was reached. Additionally, I optimized API requests by grouping them and only fetching data when necessary 
(e.g., when the user changes a category or performs a search).

2. Handling Asynchronous API Calls
   
Challenge: Managing asynchronous API calls while ensuring a smooth user experience was challenging. There were times when data loading took longer,
 causing the UI to be unresponsive or display incomplete data.

Solution: I used React's useEffect and useState hooks with async/await to handle API calls effectively. To improve the user experience,
I added loading indicators and proper error handling, allowing the app to gracefully manage delays or errors in fetching data.


3. Firebase Deployment
Challenge: Configuring Firebase for hosting and deploying the app was initially tricky, especially when managing environment-specific configurations like API keys.
Solution: I ensured sensitive information like the API key was managed using environment variables and .env files. Additionally,
I followed Firebase's hosting guidelines and ensured smooth deployment by testing configurations locally before deploying.
